# Minimal mod allowing incompatibility with the base mod

This mod is incompatible with the base mod and removes nearly all features from the game.
It is meant for mod development, gameplay is not really possible with only this mod enabled.

This mod provides the minimal prototypes needed to load the game without the base mod.
Modders are encouraged to build their own mod on top of this one or depend on this mod to aid development of mods incompatible with the base mod.

**To load the game with this mod enabled, you have to disabled the base mod: Open mod-list.json, find "base" and set "enabled" to false.
If you do not do this, this mod will most likely not be loaded by the game.**
